	abstract = {Loss of androgen receptor (AR) signaling dependence occurs in approximately 15\%-20\% of advanced treatment-resistant prostate cancers, and this may manifest clinically as transformation from a prostate adenocarcinoma histology to a castration-resistant neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC-NE). The diagnosis of CRPC-NE currently relies on a metastatic tumor biopsy, which is invasive for patients and sometimes challenging to diagnose due to morphologic heterogeneity. By studying whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of cell free DNA (cfDNA) and of matched metastatic tumor biopsies from patients with metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma and CRPC-NE, we identified CRPC-NE features detectable in the circulation. Overall, there was markedly higher concordance between cfDNA and biopsy tissue genomic alterations in patients with CRPC-NE compared with castration-resistant adenocarcinoma, supporting greater intraindividual genomic consistency across metastases. Allele-specific copy number and serial sampling analyses allowed for the detection and tracking of clonal and subclonal tumor cell populations. cfDNA methylation was indicative of circulating tumor content fraction, reflective of methylation patterns observed in biopsy tissues, and was capable of detecting CRPC-NE-associated epigenetic changes (e.g., hypermethylation of ASXL3 and SPDEF; hypomethylation of INSM1 and CDH2). A targeted set combining genomic (TP53, RB1, CYLD, AR) and epigenomic (hypo- and hypermethylation of 20 differential sites) alterations applied to ctDNA was capable of identifying patients with CRPC-NE.},

	abstract = {Differentially DNA methylated regions (DMRs) inform on the role of epigenetic changes in cancer. We present Rocker-meth, a computational method exploiting a heterogeneous hidden Markov model to detect DMRs across multiple experimental platforms. Its application to more than 6,000 methylation profiles across 14 tumor types provides a comprehensive catalog of tumor type-specific and shared DMRs, also amenable to single-cell DNA-methylation data. In depth integrative analysis including orthogonal omics shows the enhanced ability of Rocker-meth in recapitulating known associations, further uncovering the pan-cancer relationship between DNA hypermethylation and transcription factor deregulation depending on the baseline chromatin state.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The method of delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 into target cells is a strong determinant of efficacy and specificity in genome editing. Even though high efficiency of Cas9 delivery is necessary for optimal editing, its long-term and high levels of expression correlate with increased off-target activity. We developed vesicles (VEsiCas) carrying CRISPR-SpCas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) that are efficiently delivered into target cells through the fusogenic glycoprotein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). A crucial step for VEsiCas production is the synthesis of the single guide RNA (sgRNA) mediated by the T7 RNA polymerase in the cytoplasm of producing cells as opposed to canonical U6-driven Pol III nuclear transcription. In VEsiCas, the absence of DNA encoding SpCas9 and sgRNA allows rapid clearance of the nuclease components in target cells, which correlates with reduced genome-wide off-target cleavages. Compared with SpCas9 RNPs electroporation, which is currently the method of choice to obtain transient SpCas9 activity, VEsiCas deliver the nuclease with higher efficiency and lower toxicity. We show that a wide variety of cells can be edited through VEsiCas, including a variety of transformed cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and cardiomyocytes, in vivo. VEsiCas is a traceless CRISPR-Cas9 delivery tool for efficient and safe genome editing that represents a further advancement toward the therapeutic use of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology.},

	abstract = {Tumor DNA circulates in the plasma of cancer patients admixed with DNA from noncancerous cells. The genomic landscape of plasma DNA has been characterized in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) but the plasma methylome has not been extensively explored. Here, we performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) on plasma DNA with and without bisulfite treatment from mCRPC patients receiving either abiraterone or enzalutamide in the pre- or post-chemotherapy setting. Principal component analysis on the mCRPC plasma methylome indicated that the main contributor to methylation variance (principal component one, or PC1) was strongly correlated with genomically determined tumor fraction (r = -0.96; P {\textless} 10-8) and characterized by hypermethylation of targets of the polycomb repressor complex 2 components. Further deconvolution of the PC1 top-correlated segments revealed that these segments are comprised of methylation patterns specific to either prostate cancer or prostate normal epithelium. To extract information specific to an individual's cancer, we then focused on an orthogonal methylation signature, which revealed enrichment for androgen receptor binding sequences and hypomethylation of these segments associated with AR copy number gain. Individuals harboring this methylation pattern had a more aggressive clinical course. Plasma methylome analysis can accurately quantitate tumor fraction and identify distinct biologically relevant mCRPC phenotypes.},
